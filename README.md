# FBI-Gun-Dataset-Investigation
This project entails that a data analysis of the FBI Gun dataset is conducted, starting with looking at the data to see possible questions that can be answered by it.  The FBI Gun Data is an extract of two database files, one consisting of data from the FBI's National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS), which is used to assess a potential buyer's eligibility for firearms and the other consisting of data from the US census for particular periods. These statistics from the NICS table represent the number of firearm background checks initiated through the system and the checks performed guarantees that buyers have no criminal history and are eligible to purchase weapons. From 1998 through 2017, the data reflects the number of firearm checks performed by state, month, and type of firearm. The NICS dataset presented above is complemented with state-level census statistics of United States of America which provides various population variables information.
